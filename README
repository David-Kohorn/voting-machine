To use the program, ensure all files are downloaded to the same directory and run VotingMachine.java

This project contains a simulated election where users can modify ballot candiates, vote for candidates and calculate the winner of the election. 
All votes are a ranking of 3 of the candidates on the simulated ballot, and a winner can be chosen in 2 ways, requested by the user:
1. Most First Votes Strategy: Chooses a winner based on the candidate with the most #1 rankings
2. Most Agreeable Strategy: Chooses a winner based on the candidate with the most votes in a single ranking category


All code was created by David Kohorn.
